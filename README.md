# Problem Solving - Luhn Algorithm

A stretch activity from Lighthouse Labs (W01D5)

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

In this exercise, we intend to reproduce the behaviour of the [Luhn Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).

## Example

`49927398716`

should return `true`

`79927398712`

should return `false`
